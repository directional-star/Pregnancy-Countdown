Excited expectant parents are continuously asking themselves how much longer until the baby arrives or wondering how big their little sprout is. Pregnancy Countdown is an [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E) skill built to help these anxious parents know the answers to those questions simply by asking. Pregnancy Countdown will record the baby's due date and then give the size of the baby, how far along the pregnancy is, or the time left in the pregnancy upon request.
